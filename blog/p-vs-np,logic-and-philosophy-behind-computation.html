If we want to prove one <strong>NP</strong> problem as <strong>NP-complete</strong>, we need not to prove every <strong>NP</strong> problem being reduceable to that problem we can just prove that <strong>NP</strong> problem can reduced into <strong>NP-complete</strong>.

It’s is not just a mathematical problem but a philosophical one, “Is finding solutions harder than verifying them?” ( since <strong>P</strong> class problems can be solved easier, <strong>NP</strong> class problem are verified easier ).</p><p>we might think intuitively, “finding solutions is harder than verifying solutions” like “writing a great poem should be harder than checking a great poem”. Even the famous physicist Feynman had trouble even being convinced that <strong>P</strong> vs. <strong>NP</strong> was an open problem!</p><p>Because, All <strong>NP</strong> problems require brute-force search ( searching all possible states for solution ) which results in the exponential time requirement. So to believe <strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong>, we need to assume there is a general efficient way to solve every <strong>NP</strong> problem. which is also a hard thing to assume against our Intuition.</p><p>we generally believe the conjecture that <strong>P</strong> ≠ <strong>NP</strong> but It’s very HARD to prove it!!</p><p>because, “A fundamental challenge when proving <strong>P</strong> ≠ <strong>NP</strong> is that, we have to separate <strong>NP</strong> problems that are actually HARD from the problems that just look HARD or used to be assumed HARD”. problems like primality testing, DNA sequencing which were assumed to be <strong>NP</strong> are now in <strong>P</strong>. the proofs that tried to prove, <strong>P</strong> ≠ <strong>NP</strong> can be rejected with this simple reason. as If we were to believe they work, then these polynomial reducible problems shouldn’t exist in the first place!</p><p>We can however reduce scope to make our proof more stable, here <strong>NP-complete</strong> comes into picture. remember that any <strong>NP-complete</strong> problem can be converted into any <strong>NP</strong> class problem. so, If we’re able to prove one <strong>NP-complete</strong> problem is equal to (or) not equal to <strong>P</strong>. we prove all problems of <strong>NP</strong> are equal to (or) not equal to <strong>NP</strong>.</p><p>Repercussions of proving <strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong> are massive, If <strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong> many other complexity classes fall into <strong>P</strong> as well like <strong>co-NP</strong>,  <strong>Πk P</strong>, <strong>Σk P</strong>.</p><p>with <strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong>, </p><p>any reasonable length mathematical proof can be found efficiently by an algorithm! ( because even though in polynomial <strong>N^k</strong>, if the k is big It would be inefficient ). </p><p>the idea that such problem is in <strong>NP</strong> was actually pointed out by Kurt Godel in his 1956  letter to von neumann. he wrote, “Consider the problem of deciding whether a mathematical statement S has a proof in F with n symbols or fewer. we could always just program a computer to search through all <strong>2^n</strong> possible bit-strings with n symbols, and check whether any of them encodes a valid F-proof of S.”</p><p>Godel also pointed out, “it’s far from obvious how to prove that there isn’t a muchbetter approach: an approach that would avoid brute-force search, and find proofs of size n in time polynomial in n”. essentially discussing, proving <strong>P</strong> ≠ <strong>NP</strong> is HARD. the formal conjecture of <strong>P</strong> vs <strong>NP</strong> was formulated by cook in his 1971 paper.</p><p><strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong> will also mean AI would be perfect as we can simply search large tree of possibilities in polynomial time. VLSI designers can design optimum circuits with minimum power requirements. any scientist can obtain the simplest theory that explains his/her experimental data, by Occam’s razor this is supposed to be the correct one! </p><p>as said earlier in summary, “Any problem whose solution that can be verified easily, can be produced approximately that much easily”.</p><p>It may also rule out the need of randomized algorithms, stochasticity principle as the gains will be negligible.</p><p>On the other hand, all our cryptographic algorithms are designed with the assumption of existence of one-way functions which in turn assumes <strong>P</strong> ≠ <strong>NP</strong>. so, there can be trivial decoding algorithms for every cryptographic algorithm, causing vulnerability to our security, privacy, data integrity.</p><p>so, this is the explanation I felt sufficient for intuitively understanding complexity. because, I saw even experienced people having confusion over these ( cough cough tutorialspoint guy ).</p><p>the main intention of writing this article, is to introduce these concepts intuitively to wider audience and to give motivation to CS students that they’re doing something really fundamental than just programming stuff. sadly, I was introduced to these concepts just before couple of months in my final year of Btech. had I been introduced to these earlier, It might’ve had significant impact in my formative years of undergraduation. which I hope happens to someone else. remember to get away from your engineering lens to a scientist lens once in a while. </p><p>an engineer will accept the rules they’re given and try to solve problems with those rules, a scientist will question the rules itself. a mechanical engineer may design machines without realizing that forces are illusion but a physicist would realize that. similarly, a software engineer will develop algorithms without realizing the underlying assumptions.</p><p>there are potential things that I missed (or) trivialized above for better understanding. as I’m fairly inexperienced, if there’re any errors above feel free to point out by my twitter handle. </p><h3 id="references"><a href="#references" class="anchor"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>References:</h3><ol><li>Introduction to the theory of computation - M Sipser</li><li>The history and status of P versus NP Question - M Sipser</li><li>Computational complexity a modern approach - S Arora, B Barak</li><li>The nature of computation - C Moore, S Mertens</li><li>What can be computed?
